# mothman bot
this is a discord bot built for internal use by the dev team of the game [blue ridge hunting](https://blueridgehunting.com). it allows us to run and manage builds on unity cloud's build automation service.

the bot contains some hard-coded values for things our internal discord server & roles, but with a little modification, this can be used as a general-purpose bot for controlling unity build automation :)
